# Using-Tor-With-Python
 This is one way to use Tor with the Request Library in Python. I hope you find it useful.

pre-requisite:
1. pip install requests
2. pip install requests[socks]
3. pip install requests[security]

*This program runs well in Python 3.7 and linux. In windows, it will create problem due to firewall issues.*

Tip: If you are really concerned about your privacy then use linux :-p
